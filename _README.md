OpenShift CakePHP - Hello World

Based on 'CakePHP: Hello World!' at http://deepbluespaces.blogspot.nl/2008/05/cakephp-hello-world.html

This is a CakePHP application on OpenShift that has no database and tries to be a simple as possible, just showing 'Hello World!' on its page.

***NOTE***: Use /openshift/cakephp-hello-world.json as the template!
